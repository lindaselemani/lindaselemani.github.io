            <b> Brief Summary of Life History </b> <br>
            l am a girl aged 20 currently doing a Software Engineering program at an <br> 
            Innovation and Technopreneural University, Harare lnstitute of Technology.<br>
            My life at this institute is somewhat a bit challenging if not because of<br>
            the many programing languages l have to keep up with. <br>Nevertheless,the fun 
            part of being a part of this big family is you get to know a lot of <br>people 
            from different departments which is a very wonderful experience.<br>
            My friends at HIT have become a special part of my life and l am very <br>
            proud to share with you my everyday life experiences with them.<br>
            Life at HIT
            <a href="fun moments.html" target = "blank"> Click here </a> to see pictures. I must
            admit that there is more to my life that many people would find so amusing and
            <br> surprising if they were to get the chance to know me better. Firstly,
             l am a very strong member of a church guild, Agnes and Alois where <br> we  go to 
             share the goodness of the Lord in our lives.<br> Secondly, 
            when given the platform to say what l want, l can be very talkative and very frank too.
            l can be very friendly as well as ver serious <br> too which makes people think l 
            like to keep a military style relationship with the people l associate with.
            The other thing is l am <br> a very good singer which most of the peoole are yet to 
            find out.l sing when l am bathing, cooking, alone and l love recording myself 
            a lot.l do <br>watch a lot of movies too and here are some of the songs l listen to.<br>
